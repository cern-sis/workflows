        "symmetry of the exceptional algebra, while the super Chern-Simons matrix model is described by the free "
        "energy of topological strings on the del Pezzo background with the symmetry broken. We study the symmetry "
        "breaking of the quantum cousin of the algebraic curve and reproduce the results in the super Chern-Simons matrix model.",
        "We discuss in detail the distributions of energy, radial pressure and tangential pressure inside the nucleon. "
        "In particular, this discussion is carried on in both the instant form and the front form of dynamics. Moreover "
        "we show for the first time how these mechanical concepts can be defined when the average nucleon momentum does "
        "not vanish. We express the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and stability in terms of these two and "
        "three-dimensional energy and pressure distributions. We briefly discuss the phenomenological relevance of our "
        "findings with a simple yet realistic model. In the light of this exhaustive mechanical description of the "
        "nucleon, we also present several possible connections between hadronic physics and compact stars, like e.g. "
        "the study of the equation of state for matter under extreme conditions and stability constraints.",
        "This paper describes a strategy for a general search used by the ATLAS Collaboration to find potential indications "
        "of new physics. Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class "
        "an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in s"
        "everal distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified using "
        "pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up "
        "analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset "
        "allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is "
        "discussed using Standard Model processes and benchmark signals of new physics. As an example, results are shown "
        "for 3.2 fb $$^{-1}$$ of proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $$\\text {TeV}$$ collected with the ATLAS detector "
        "at the LHC in 2015, in which more than 700 event classes and more than $$10^5$$ regions have been analysed. No significant "
        "deviations are found and consequently no data-derived signal regions for a follow-up analysis have been defined.",

        "e_a^\\mp $$ , $$Z\\rightarrow e_b^\\pm e_a^\\mp $$ , and "
